# Livefront React Native Coding Challenge

This solution leverages [Expo](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/overview/) and [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go) to provide the quickest setup and installation of the project. It could easily be extended into a development build in order to add native functionality if necessary.

**NOTE: The app is designed for Android and iOS but it is functional on the web.**
